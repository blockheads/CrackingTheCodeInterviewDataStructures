# CrackingTheCodeInterviewDataStructures
Data structures for cracking the code interview

I made this to help me study all the main Data Types in Cracking the Code Interview,

I hope that this resource can be usefull to other's curious on implementing the same data structures.

For each chapter in Cracking the code module, I have created a module corresponding, with implementations for each of the data
structures.

## Data Structures

### Chapter 1 Arrays & Strings

- HashTable
- Array List
- String Builder

### Chapter 2 Linked Lists

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
